# Title: Subarray Sum 2.0

## Problem Statement:

Given an array of integers A. Your task is to design an algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum such that no two elements in the subarray are adjacent to each other.

## Input:

The first line contains an integer $N$ $(1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5)$, the length of the array.
The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, …, A_n (1 ≤ A_i ≤ 10^5)$ denoting the array.

## Output:

Print the maximum subarray sum.

## Example:

**Input:**

4
3 2 7 10

**Output:**

13
